> This paper under review for publication in SMC 21.

This work presents a real-time cognitive  workload estimation, from multiple parameters of an operatorâ€™s driving behaviour,via the use of behavioural entropy. With the introduction of a Driver Profile Update (DPU) algorithm the cognitive workload estimation adapts to the evolving driving profile of individual operators. Finaly, the effects of a Warning And Indication System (WAIS) are presented. WAIS uses cognitive workload estimations to issue warnings to the operator.
